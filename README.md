Three observations I found from doing this assignment are:
1. The closer you get to the equator, the hotter the max temp is recorded. As seen by the scatter plot Latitude vs Max Tempature. There is a direct pattern you can notice (rainbow pattern)

2. The further away you get from the equator, it's possible that you get more wind speed based off the scatter plot. Latitudes around 80 showed the highest wind speeds.

3. There didn't appear to be a direct corrolation between humidity and latitude, as shown by the scatter plot, most of the percents were scatted randomly with no noticable pattern.


The only time I had trouble with this assignment was when I made too many API calls within a one-hour span and my account was temporarly blocked. Also I'm not sure how to hide my API key on github, so I'm worried that someone will take it. Can you show me how to do that for the future?
